        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Overall Growth in Support:</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Maoist Centre saw an increase in vote counts in 9 out of the 13 wards, suggesting an
          upward trend in support across most regions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Notably large increases are observed in Wards 3, 9, 12, and 13, indicating a substantial
          expansion of their voter base in these areas.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Consistent Strengths:</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 3: The party’s support surged from 332 votes in 2074 to 555 votes in 2079, making
          it one of the strongest wards for Maoist Centre.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 12 also saw a significant gain, with Maoist Centre moving from 280 votes in 2074
          to 466 in 2079, which put it in a leading position over other parties.

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Decline in Certain Wards:</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • In Ward 6, Maoist Centre’s votes dropped from 264 to 216, with CPN-UML gaining a
          strong lead here. This indicates a need for revitalized efforts to regain ground.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 11 saw Maoist Centre lose its presence entirely, with no recorded votes in 2079,
          highlighting a potential disengagement or strategic loss in this area.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Emerging Competitive Wards:</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 1 and Ward 10 saw moderate increases in Maoist Centre’s votes, with +129 and +72
          votes, respectively. These wards reflect areas of growing support where the party can
          potentially establish dominance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 13 saw +181 votes, significantly improving Maoist Centre’s position, though
          competition remains from Nepali Congress and other candidates.

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Challenges in Highly Competitive Wards:</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 8 remains a challenge, as Maoist Centre’s small increase (from 198 to 220 votes)
          was overshadowed by strong performances from both CPN-UML and Nepali Congress.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          • Ward 7 shows a similar trend, with a modest increase for Maoist Centre, but still
          trailing.
